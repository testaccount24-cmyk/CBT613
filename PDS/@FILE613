//***FILE 613 is from Mark Crabtree and contains JCL to create a    *   FILE 613
//*           one-pack MVS "Rescue System" from your currently      *   FILE 613
//*           installed z/OS 1.2 production system.  In Mark's      *   FILE 613
//*           case, the newly created system fits on one 3390-3     *   FILE 613
//*           disk pack.                                            *   FILE 613

//*           The idea here is to be able to rebuild (or rather     *   FILE 613
//*           "refresh") your own rescue system, as your production *   FILE 613
//*           MVS system changes over time.                         *   FILE 613
