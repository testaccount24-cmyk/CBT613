Sam,
I agree that maybe our site-specific libraries shouldn't have
been in the JCL. I had left them in there primarily as an example
to illustrate how we keep our recovery JCL, etc. across rebuilds
of the RESCUE system.  It may have been better to either take
them out of the jobstream or indicate that this is where a shop
could put their site-specific jobs, doc, etc. for rebuilding a
system.  What I have done with the SYS0.RESCUE.* libraries is
keep a copy of them on a volume that stays around permanently.
Then the rebuild just puts the corresponding ones (PARMLIB,
PROCLIB, etc.) in them so they can be put back and recustomized
if necessary.
