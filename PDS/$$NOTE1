Sam,
Here is my JCL jobstream to create a z/OS 1.2 single volume RESCUE
system.  It fits nicely on a 3390-3.  I know there are one or two
other examples of this, so I don't know if you would have any
interest in putting it on the CBT tape or not, so use it or pitch
it at your discretion.  Since it is just a JCL jobstream, I have
not put it in XMIT format.  Let me know if you have any questions.
